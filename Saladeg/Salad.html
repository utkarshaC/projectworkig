                <h1>Prepration Steps</h1>


                <ol>
                    <li>Preheat the oven to 180°C/350°F/gas 4. Crush 1 teaspoon of cumin seeds in a pestle and mortar. </li>
                    <li>Scrub 2 small sweet potatoes and rub with the crushed cumin seeds.</li>
                    <li>Place in a roasting tray and cook in the oven for 30 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Meanwhile, trim the tough end off 1 broccoli stalk, slice it, then chop the rest into large florets.</li>
                    <li>Toss the broccoli into the sweet potato tray with 1 tablespoon of olive oil.</li>
                    <li>Roast for another 30 minutes, or until the sweet potatoes are cooked through.</li>
                    <li>Toast 25g of cashew nuts and 25g of mixed pumpkin, sunflower and sesame seeds in a dry frying pan on a medium heat until smelling fantastic, then crush in the pestle and mortar.</li>
                    <li>Bash and mush up 250g of vac-packed beetroot in their pack as much as you can, then snip the corner off and decant into a bowl with 2 tablespoons of balsamic vinegar and 1 tablespoon of extra virgin olive oil.
                        Mix together, mashing with a fork, if needed.
                    </li>
                    <li>Cook 300g of quinoa according to the packet instructions, and drain well. Pick and finely chop the leaves from 1 bunch of mint (reserving the pretty ones for garnish) and 
                        stir through the quinoa with the finely grated zest and the juice from 1 lemon, then season to perfection. </li>
                    <li> Scatter the quinoa across a large platter. Once cool enough to handle, tear over chunks of roasted sweet potato and dot over the roasted broccoli. </li>
                    <li>Halve 1 ripe avocado and use a teaspoon to add curls of flesh to the platter. </li>
                    <li>Dollop over 6 tablespoons of natural yoghurt, spoon bombs of dressed beets on top, scatter over the toasted nuts and seeds and the reserved mint leaves, snip over 1 punnet of cress and serve.</li>
